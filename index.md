## The Dawg With A Blog: High-school Hurdles 

<br>

### <ins>In this blog, we will be learning about the **coolest** guy ever...*drumroll please* **Selah!!** and his professional & personal experiences</ins>

### My name is Selah. My sophomore year of high school is where it felt like I actually arrived at high school. Sophomore Year was very enjoyable, I saw myself grow and change quite a lot. Junior year was my most stressful year, but I am not going to let the past deter me from my goals for senior year.

# Intro: 


### Freshman year was a very different year for me. My class came into high school from graduating from online school caused by COVID-19, so things felt very different and I needed time to adjust to it all again.  

### I had an accident at the end of my freshman year causing me to have to transfer schools. Now not only did I have to meet new people, I had to familiarize myself amongst the new school environment.  I am now in my senior year, and I can say I am well familiarized with my new school, but I'm really just ready to get my diploma. A Dawg’s tired… 

### Sophomore year is where my school life really picked up. I remember having a pretty decent schedule. Classes with people I liked, teachers that were pretty enjoyable. Most of my favorite memories occurred outside of school or even outside of school hours. My friends and I would go play basketball, but the best part wouldn't even be the end destination, it would be the little side detours and tomfoolery that occurred on the way. 
### To be frank, I had many enjoyable experiences in my freshman year of high school.  For example, Mcdonald’s came out with the On App Mcdonald’s hacks menu item.  These menu items included the Surf & Turf, Crunchy Double, Land, Air & Sea, and Hashbrown McMuffin.  I made it my personal journey to try each and every one of those meals before they were gone forever.  Even though the meals could be easily replicated, and made again if I really wanted to, the magic won't be there anymore.  My personal ranking of them are…
* Crunchy Double
* Surf+Turf
* Land, Air & Sea
* Hash Brown McMuffin

### Back to Sophomore year, I was helping my brother with a local election that he was running for.  Being a volunteer for somebody made me shift my interests career wise.  Coming from my old freshman school made me interested in culinary arts. I sadly had to learn the hard way that a Dog like me doesnt get in the kitchen unless it's to eat.  But I'm a culinary threat when I'm baking or on a grill. I slowly started to shift interests in what I wanted to do with my future career wise.  I took interest in media design.  The passion grew when I joined the FSD(Full-Stack Development) pathway in STEAM. I was able to apply a creative touch to my coding assignments.  


#### I am making a blog about myself for my Full-Stack Development class at the [Brooklyn Steam Center.](http://brooklynsteamcenter.org) I also made A [personal website](shMemphis.github.io) in my junior year of Highschool.
